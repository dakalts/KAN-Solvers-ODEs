Comparison of Efficient KAN, Fast KAN, and MLP Models for Solving a Simple ODE

This project implements and compares three neural network architectures:

    Efficient KAN (Kernel Activation Network)

    Fast KAN

    Standard MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)

The comparison is done in the context of solving a simple first-order ODE using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).

We solve the differential equation:

$$\frac{dx}{dt} =-x(t) + sin(t)\,. $$
